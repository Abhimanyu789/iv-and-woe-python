# Churn analysis using IV and WOE in Python

Attribute relevance analysis helps in recognizing the most important variables which have the greatest impact on target variable and understanding relations and logic between the most important predictors and the target variable.

Information value (IV) and weight of evidence (WOE) are simple and powerful techniques of conducting attribute relevance analysis. They provide a great framework for exploratory analysis and have been used extensively in the credit risk world for several decades.
